# SmackdownRatingsPredictor
Application to predict the final Smackdown Rating from the overnight number. 


Every week the 'overnight' ratings number comes out for WWE Smackdown on Fox, this number is called the fast national number and usually differs slightly from the offical rating that is released on a Monday or Tuesday. 

The idea behind this application is to create a Machine Learning application that is able to predict the final ratings number based on the fast national number.
